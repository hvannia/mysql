--  1a. Display the first and last names of all actors from the table `actor`.
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM actor;

-- * 1b. Display the first and last name of each actor in a single column in upper case letters. Name the column `Actor Name`.
SELECT CONCAT(UPPER(first_name),' ', UPPER(last_name)) AS `Actor Name` FROM actor;

-- * 2a. You need to find the ID number, first name, and last name of an actor, of whom you know only the first name, "Joe." 
-- What is one query would you use to obtain this information?
SELECT actor_id, first_name, last_name  FROM actor

SELECT actor_id, first_name, last_name  FROM actor

-- * 2c. Find all actors whose last names contain the letters `LI`. This time, order the rows by last name and first name, in that order:
SELECT actor_id, first_name, last_name  FROM actor

-- * 2d. Using `IN`, display the `country_id` and `country` columns of the following countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and China:
SELECT country_id, country FROM country
WHERE country IN ('Afghanistan','Bangladesh','China');

-- * 3a. You want to keep a description of each actor. You don't think you will be performing queries on a description, so 
-- create a column in the table `actor` named `description` and use the data type `BLOB` (Make sure to research the type `BLOB`,
--  as the difference between it and `VARCHAR` are significant).
ALTER TABLE actor 
ADD COLUMN description BLOB;

-- * 3b. Very quickly you realize that entering descriptions for each actor is too much effort. Delete the `description` column.
ALTER TABLE actor

UPDATE actor SET first_name='HARPO' WHERE first_name='GROUCHO' AND last_name='WILLIAMS';

-- * 4d. Perhaps we were too hasty in changing `GROUCHO` to `HARPO`. It turns out that `GROUCHO` was the correct name after all! In a single query, if the first name of the actor is currently `HARPO`, change it to `GROUCHO`.
UPDATE actor SET first_name = 'GROUCHO'

-- * 6d. How many copies of the film `Hunchback Impossible` exist in the inventory system?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM inventory WHERE film_id in (SELECT film_id FROM film WHERE title = 'Hunchback Impossible');

-- * 6e. Using the tables `payment` and `customer` and the `JOIN` command, list the total paid by each customer. List the customers alphabetically by last name:

-- * 7a. The music of Queen and Kris Kristofferson have seen an unlikely resurgence. As an unintended consequence, films starting with the letters `K` and `Q` 
-- have also soared in popularity. Use subqueries to display the titles of movies starting with the letters `K` and `Q` whose language is English.
SELECT f.title, 
(SELECT name from language WHERE language_id = f.language_Id AND name='English' )

WHERE actor_id  IN (SELECT actor_id FROM film_actor
WHERE film_id = (SELECT film_id FROM film WHERE title='Alone Trip'));

-- * 7c. You want to run an email marketing campaign in Canada, for which you will need the names and email addresses of all Canadian customers.

JOIN city AS ci ON ci.city_id = a.address_id
JOIN country AS co ON co.country_id = ci.country_id;

-- * 7h. List the top five genres in gross revenue in descending order. (**Hint**: you may need to use the following tables: 
-- category, film_category, inventory, payment, and rental.)

 FROM category as cat
 JOIN film_category AS fc ON fc.category_id= cat.category_id

 GROUP BY cat.name
 ORDER BY sales desc;
 
-- * 8a. In your new role as an executive, you would like to have an easy way of viewing the Top five genres by gross revenue.
--  Use the solution from the problem above to create a view. If you haven't solved 7h, you can substitute another query to create a view.
